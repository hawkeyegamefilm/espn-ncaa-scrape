one that was explosive on offense, dominant on defense and\nin control from start to finish.\n\nIowa rolled past Minnesota 52-28 on Saturday, ending a regular\nseason that started with huge expectations but didn't quite live up\nto the hype -- until the final two games.\n\nAfter winning at then-No. 19 Wisconsin a week ago to break a\ntwo-game losing streak, the Hawkeyes were even better against\nMinnesota. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=127957\">Ed Hinkel</a> caught four touchdown passes to set a Kinnick\nStadium record, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160866\">Damian Sims</a> scored on a 71-yard run and Iowa shut\ndown the nation's best rushing offense.\n\n\"We expected to start the season off with this type of play,\"\nIowa running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146012\">Albert Young</a> said. \"It didn't go that way.\nThat's football. A lot of things don't always fall the way you\nplanned.\n\n\"But as long as you finish strong, and that's what we did,\nthat's all that matters.\"\n\nIowa (7-4, 5-3 Big Ten) improved its bowl prospects with its\nfifth straight victory over Minnesota, which lost star running back\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146107\">Laurence Maroney</a> in the first quarter and fell behind 35-0 less\nthan 25 minutes into the game.\n\nThe Hawkeyes set the tone by dropping Minnesota (7-4, 4-4) for\nlosses on three of its first six running plays. The Gophers, who\ncame in averaging a nation-leading 295 yards a game rushing, were\nheld to 63 yards in the first half and 129 for the game.\n\n\"Those first two possessions really changed the tone because we\nknew they were going to come out running,\" Iowa cornerback Jovon\nJohnson said. \"I know it kind of had them thinking, 'If we can't\nrun the ball what are we going to do?' It kind of changed the\nmomentum of the game.\"\n\nOn offense, Iowa did pretty much what it wanted in compiling a\nseason-high 613 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146009\">Drew Tate</a> completed his first seven passes\nand the line gave Sims and Young plenty of running room. The\nHawkeyes were so efficient that wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=133740\">Clinton Solomon</a> even\nthrew a touchdown pass.\n\n\"So much of football is mental,\" Minnesota coach Glen Mason\nsaid. \"You always look at why? I don't know why. Did you perform\nwell? No. Why? I don't know.\"\n\nHinkel caught touchdown passes of 46, 38 and 3 yards from Tate\nand 26 yards from Solomon, who was a quarterback in high school.\nTate also threw a 6-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145994\">Scott Chandler</a> and finished\n19-of-32 for 351 yards and one interception.\n\nHinkel, who missed three games after breaking his arm at Purdue\non Oct. 8, had seven catches in all for 151 yards. Four players\nheld the old stadium record of three TD catches in a game. The last\nto do it was Jim Mauro against Iowa State in 1986.\n\n\"I think everybody wants to make the last game one they're\ngoing to remember,\" said Hinkel, one of 24 seniors playing in\nKinnick for the final time. \"It's been something that's been\nfloating around all week. You're always going to remember your last\none, so we wanted to go out and be successful as a class.\"\n\nMaroney, who was averaging 149.4 yards a game, aggravated an\ninjury to his right ankle that kept him out of the Gophers' victory\nover Michigan State a week ago. He limped off the field after a\n1-yard gain late in the first quarter and did not return, finishing\nwith 10 yards in seven carries.\n\n\"He had it in his mind he could go. But when it came time to\ngo, he couldn't,\" Mason said. \"So the next question is, 'Does\nthat hurt you?' Sure it does, because he's a great football\nplayer.\"\n\nIowa led 45-7 after three quarters and Minnesota did not score\nan offensive touchdown until <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160783\">Gary Russell</a>'s 16-yard run with 11:29\nleft. The Gophers' only first-half score came on John Shevlin's\n60-yard interception return.\n\nOne consolation for the Gophers was that Russell reached 1,000\nyards, making Minnesota the first team in NCAA history to have two\n1,000-yard rushers in three consecutive seasons.\n\nRussell carried 17 times for 78 yards to run his total to 1,045,\nwhile Maroney has 1,355. Maroney and Marion Barber III both reached\n1,000 yards in 2003 and 2004.\n\nBut Iowa was the better running team Saturday. Sims went for 104\nyards in eight carries, while Young carried 21 times for 103 yards.\n\n\"They were supposed to have the three-headed monster,\" Young\nsaid. \"Today, we had the two-headed monster with the offensive\nline.\"\n\nSims sprinted straight up the middle for his touchdown on the\nthird play of the second quarter to make it 21-0. On the Hawkeyes'\nnext possession, Solomon took a handoff as if he were running an\nend around, stopped and hit Hinkel in stride on their 26-yard\ntouchdown play.\n\nTwo plays later, Chad Greenway's interception gave Iowa the ball\nat the Minnesota 5. On the next snap, Young shot through a huge\nhole untouched into the end zone for a 35-0 lead with 5:57 left in\nthe half.\n\nForced to throw more than usual, Minnesota's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=133808\">Bryan Cupito</a> was\n26-for-46 for 315 yards and one touchdown, a 3-yarder to Logan\nPayne against Iowa's reserves.\n\nAll the Gophers can do now is await their bowl bid. Ditto for\nIowa.\n\n\"I know we helped our chances today,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz\nsaid. \"We're going to be thrilled to go where we go.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
