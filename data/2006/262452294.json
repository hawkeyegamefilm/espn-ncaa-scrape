season opener, but it didn't matter thanks to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146009\">Drew Tate</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146012\">Albert Young</a> and an opponent without a running game.\n\nTate threw for 223 yards and three touchdowns and Young added\n148 yards of total offense and two scores to lead No. 16 Iowa past\nthe I-AA Grizzlies 41-7 on Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145994\">Scott Chandler</a> and freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188287\">Dominique Douglas</a> had TD catches for\nthe Hawkeyes (1-0), who christened newly renovated Kinnick Stadium\nwith a dominant defensive performance. Iowa held Division I-AA\nMontana (0-1) to 10 yards rushing, and 144 yards overall, en route\nto its 19th win in 20 home games.\n\nBut it wasn't always pretty. Iowa has nine new starters from\nlast year's Outback Bowl squad, and at times it showed. The\nHawkeyes' coverage teams were spotty, their young receiving corps\ndropped more than a few of Tate's passes and they picked up eight\npenalties after averaging just 4.3 a game in 2005.\n\n\"There's certainly a lot of things we have to clean up. But I\nthink the guys got ready mentally. The effort was there,\" coach\nKirk Ferentz said. \"Nothing really looked crisp out there. But\npart of that was our opponent.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies, playing in front of the biggest crowd in school\nhistory (70,585), gave away too much physically to compete.\nQuarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=115704\">Josh Swogger</a> spent much of the afternoon running for\nhis life, as Montana was no match for the Hawkeyes in the trenches.\n\n\"It's tough when you've got 600 pounds on you on every play.\nWe're not used to it. It's a different breed going into I-A,\"\nlinebacker Tyler Joyce said.\n\nThe Grizzlies did, however, give Iowa a scare midway through the\nthird quarter by cutting its lead to 17-7. Montana capitalized on a\nfumble by Young with a 44-yard drive that ended with a 7-yard TD\npass from Swogger to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145544\">Eric Allen</a>.\n\nBut that was the only time the Grizzlies crossed Iowa's 35-yard\nline.\n\n\"We're 0-1 and that's about as simple as it gets,\" Montana\ncoach Bobby Hauck said. \"Iowa's awful good up front, and we knew\nthat going in.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes answered Montana by scoring touchdowns on\nback-to-back possessions to put the game out of reach. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160771\">Andy Brodell</a>\nhauled in Tate's first long throw of the day for a 44-yard\nreception, and Tate found Chandler for a 6-yard touchdown pass to\ngive the Hawkeyes a 24-7 lead.\n\nIowa pushed its lead to 31-7 early in the fourth quarter on a\n5-yard touchdown run by Young.\n\n\"That's the way we have to respond. I think that shows a lot of\ncharacter on our team,\" Tate said. \"I think there's a lot of\nsenior leadership on this team. It's just going to have to all come\ntogether.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes held Montana to five first downs in the opening\nhalf and led 17-0 at halftime.\n\nIowa went ahead 14-0 in the second quarter on Tate's second\ntouchdown pass of the day. Young took a short pass from Tate and\nturned it into a 35-yard gain, and Tate capped an 89-yard drive\nwith a 9-yard TD pass to Douglas.\n\nThe Hawkeyes opened the scoring by moving 71 yards for a\ntouchdown on their second possession. Young, who kept the drive\ngoing with an 11-yard run on a 4th-and-1, capped it with 5-yard TD\ncatch.\n\n\"We didn't even open up our playbook,\" Young said. \"You guys\nsaw our basic package today. That's all we needed to do.\"\n\nTate's three TD passes gave him 46 for his career, moving him\ninto second place on Iowa's all-time list. Chuck Long holds the\nmark with 74.\n\nSwogger finished 16-of-28 for 134 yards with a touchdown and an\ninterception. Montana recorded its lowest point total against a\nDivision I opponent since 1982, a stretch of 22 games.\n\nThe game was the first at Kinnick since the completion of $86.8\nmillion in renovations. The makeover included a new press box and\nluxury suites, new scoreboards and a statue of Nile Kinnick, Iowa's\nonly Heisman Trophy winner."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
