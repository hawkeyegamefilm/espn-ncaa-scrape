We know we have games before\nthen. Obviously, that's the big one, but we have three more\ngames.\"\n\nNo. 2 has been a sticky spot in the Top 25 this season. Four\ntimes already this season No. 2 has gone down, including the\nprevious two weeks when Auburn and Florida fell.\n\nMichigan's first game as the second-ranked team in the country --\nand second consecutive game without injured star receiver Mario\nManningham -- wasn't easy, either.\n\n\"You have to remember where you're trying to get,\" defensive\nend LaMarr Woodley said. \"It's not where you're ranked now.\"\n\nRevered former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler, who fell ill\nFriday and was hospitalized, contacted school officials and told\nthem to let everyone know he was doing OK and watching the game.\n\nHe had to have liked what he saw.\n\nIowa, coming off a stunning 31-28 loss at Indiana that knocked\nthe Hawkeyes out of the rankings for the first time this season,\nmuscled up on defense, especially against the run.\n\nThe Hawkeyes crowded the line to contain Hart, the Big Ten's\nsecond-leading rusher, and without Manningham, the Wolverines\ncouldn't go deep.\n\nHart was held to 27 yards on eight carries in the first half,\nbut the relentless junior appeared to get stronger as the game wore\non -- Michigan needed it.\n\n\"I think we wore down there a little bit at the end, and that's\nwhat good running teams do,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said.\"\n\nIowa's Mike Humpal intercepted a pass that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160898\">Chad Henne</a> forced\ninto a crowd on the first possession of the second half at the\nMichigan 27, and it set up Kyle Schlicher's 34-yard field goal to\ntie it at 3.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=133761\">Steve Breaston</a> responded for Michigan, finding a seam in the\nmiddle and returning the ensuing kickoff 64 yards to the Iowa 35.\nThe Wolverines took advantage of the short field, with Hart running\nthrough tacklers on a 9-yard touchdown run that made it 10-3.\n\n\"You better make sure the full teams tackles him,\" Woodley\nsaid.\n\nAfter Iowa got a 22-yard field goal from Schlicher to make it\n10-6 with 2:11 left in the third quarter, Michigan went back to\nHart.\n\nHe carried six times for 34 yards to help set up a 37-yard field\ngoal by Garrett Rivas to make it 13-6 with 12:55 left in the fourth\nquarter.\n\nFor Michigan's defense, ranked seventh in the nation and first\nagainst the run, that was enough.\n\n\"They are without question the best defense we've played all\nseason,\" said Iowa quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146009\">Drew Tate</a>, who faced Ohio State\njust a few weeks ago.\n\nOn consecutive plays, Woodley and Crable sacked Tate deep in\nIowa territory. After Crable ran Tate out of bounds for his third\nsack, fellow linebacker Prescott Burgess waved his arms and urged\non the roaring crowd of more than 110,000 before the third-down\nplay.\n\nWoodley blew through a blocker on the next play and nearly got\nto Tate again.\n\n\"We knew he was hurting back there,\" Woodley said.\n\nHart put the capper on the game with a 10-yard TD run with 3:59\nleft through a big hole, one of the few he had all day. He went\nover 1,000 yards rushing for the second time in his career.\n\nTate finished 21-for-36 for 197 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188287\">Dominique Douglas</a>, who\nhas been nursing a knee injury, caught six passes for 63 yards.\nIowa could muster only 41 yards on the ground.\n\nHenne went 23-for-33 for 203 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160889\">Adrian Arrington</a> caught\neight passes for 79 yards.\n\nBut it was Hart and the running game that delivered the decisive\nblow.\n\n\"More than anything else, we had patience in calling the\nrunning game,\" Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. \"We were big in\nthe second half.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
