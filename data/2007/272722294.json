CITY, Iowa (AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174294\">Kellen Lewis</a> threw two touchdown passes and was officially credited with a third when he ran 71 yards after picking up a teammate's fumble, leading Indiana to a 38-20 victory over Iowa on Saturday.\n\nLewis made a play almost every time the Hoosiers (4-1, 1-1 Big Ten) needed one as they extended Iowa's losing streak in conference play to seven and recorded their biggest victory over the Hawkeyes since a 52-20 win in 1945.\n\nIowa (2-3, 0-2) played added to its difficulties with penalties and breakdowns in pass protection. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=169329\">Jake Christensen</a> passed for 308 yards and three TDs but was sacked nine times, with end Jammie Kirlew getting four of those sacks.\n\nThe Hawkeyes also missed two field goals, including a straight-on 25-yarder, and an extra point. The haven't won a Big Ten game since beating Purdue 47-17 last Oct. 7.\n\nLewis had standard touchdown throws of 39 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160604\">James Hardy</a> and 4 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188711\">Ray Fisher</a> in staking the Hoosiers to a 14-0 lead. His most memorable play came on an 8-yard completion to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=147262\">Josiah Sears</a> midway through the second quarter.\n\nSears fumbled when he got hit and the ball squirted toward the left sideline. Lewis was trailing the play, scooped up the ball on a dead run at his own 29, sprinted down the sideline and somersaulted into the end zone, drawing a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nLewis made another big play after Iowa drew to 21-13 on Christensen's 10-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160857\">Brandon Myers</a> in the third quarter. He hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178824\">Brandon Walker-Roby</a> for 24 yards on fourth-and-5 from the Iowa 27, setting up a 1-yard TD plunge by Sears.\n\nLewis finished 19 of 26 for a career-best 322 yards and one interception.\n\nIowa didn't get on the board until the final play of the first half and needed a bizarre play to do it -- a 33-yard Hail Mary from Christensen to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=169341\">Trey Stross</a>. Three Indiana defenders converged on the fluttering ball, which was tipped and fell into Stross' arms in the back of the end zone.\n\nHardy continued tormenting Iowa by catching four passes for 113 yards, including a 48-yarder that set up Lewis' touchdown pass to Fisher. In three games against Iowa, the 6-foot-7 junior has 24 catches for 420 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nIowa threatened a final time when Christensen hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188291\">Derrell Johnson-Koulianos</a> on an 18-yard touchdown pass, cutting the lead to 31-20 with 10:01 left.\n\nBut Lewis took the Hoosiers on a 69-yard drive that Sears finished with a 7-yard TD burst.\n\nChristensen, who has been sacked 20 times in this his first season as a starter, went 24 of 42 with one interception.\n\nIowa was missing linebacker Mike Klinkenborg, safety Devan Moylan, wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160771\">Andy Brodell</a> and tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=169337\">Tony Moeaki</a>, all out because of injuries. Klinkenborg was leading the team in tackles, while Moeaki and Brodell ranked 1-2 in receptions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236651\">Colin Sandeman</a>, also a wide receiver, injured a leg when he fumbled on a first-quarter punt return and did not come back.\n\nIndiana played without starting wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160598\">James Bailey</a>, suspended for the game for breaking an unspecified team rule."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
