href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236649\">Jevon Pugh</a> scored on a 1-yard run in double overtime, helping Iowa to a 34-27 victory over Michigan State on Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146012\">Albert Young</a> had 179 yards rushing and two touchdowns for Iowa (4-5, 2-4 Big Ten), which had rallied from a 17-3 halftime deficit. Michigan State tied the game at 20 on a 29-yard field goal by Brett Swenson with four seconds left in regulation.\n\nYoung ran 6 yards to put Iowa at the 1 in the second overtime before Pugh, a freshman, gave the Hawkeyes a 34-27 lead.\n\nThe Spartans (5-4, 1-4) reached the Iowa 9 on their second-overtime possession, but quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160772\">Brian Hoyer</a> was sacked on third down for a 7-yard loss. On fourth down, Hoyer found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183856\">Devin Thomas</a> in the flat but he was stopped well short of the first down.\n\nMichigan State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176328\">Javon Ringer</a> rumbled for 18 yards in the first overtime to put the Spartans at the 3, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146128\">Jehuu Caulcrick</a>'s TD run gave them a 27-20 lead.\n\nIowa answered with a 23-yard touchdown reception by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188284\">Paul Chaney</a> Jr. to force double OT.\n\nThe Spartans squandered a 14-point halftime lead and found themselves pinned at their own 21 with 1:32 left in regulation and no timeouts. They responded, going 67 yards for the tying field goal.\n\nCaulcrick scored three touchdowns and Hoyer was 25-of-42 for 308 yards to lead Michigan State, which lost for the fourth time in five games. The Spartans were attempting to reach bowl eligibility for the first time since 2003.\n\nIowa, which was outgained 468-283, went to Young in the second half to revive its stagnant offense.\n\nYoung sprinted 26 yards for a touchdown to bring the Hawkeyes within 17-10 early in the third quarter. He ran for 63 yards on Iowa's next drive, including a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game with 3:57 left in the third quarter.\n\nIowa took its first lead, 20-17, on Daniel Murray's 47-yard field goal with 10:05 left.\n\nThe Spartans racked up 252 yards of total offense in the first half.\n\nCaulcrick's 1-yard plunge gave Michigan State a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter, and his 1-yard score with 2:12 left in the first half put the Spartans ahead 17-3.\n\nThomas caught seven passes for 129 yards.\n\nMichigan State linebacker SirDarean Adams was a late scratch and did not travel to Iowa, school officials said, and cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183860\">T.J. Williams</a> played on special teams. Adams, Williams and reserve cornerback Jeremy Ware were charged Wednesday with unarmed robbery stemming from an April incident in the parking lot of a store.\n\nWare, who rarely plays, also didn't make the trip. No reason was given for Adams' absence.\n\nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio said this week that the players will remain on the roster and continue to have the opportunity to play as the legal process runs its course."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
