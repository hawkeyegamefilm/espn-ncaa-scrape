They followed up a humiliating home loss to Penn State by allowing their most points to Iowa since 1978.\n\nWisconsin, which reached as high as No. 8 in the polls in late September, has been outscored 86-23 the past two weeks. Dreams of a Big Ten title and a berth in the Bowl Championship Series have been replaced by questions about whether the Badgers can snap out of their funk in time to even make it to a bowl game.\n\n\"It's a mental thing, it's a discipline thing, it's an everything thing,\" Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema said. \"We need to improve what we do in all three phases of the game.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177752\">Dustin Sherer</a>, making his first career start in place of <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=156386\">Allan Evridge</a>, was 17-of-34 for 161 yards and two interceptions for the Badgers.\n\nSherer finally got Wisconsin's offense moving on its first two drives of the second half. But Iowa held the Badgers to field goals instead of touchdowns, as Philip Welch hit from 40 and 35 yards out to pull Wisconsin within 14-9 midway through the third quarter.\n\nThe Badgers would soon regret not finding the end zone.\n\nJust three plays later, Greene outran Wisconsin's defense for his longest touchdown of the year, a 52-yarder that put the Hawkeyes ahead 21-9.\n\n<a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=231932\">Paki O'Meara</a> then blocked a punt to give Iowa the ball on the Wisconsin 33. <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188298\">Ricky Stanzi</a> threw behind tight end <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236650\">Allen Reisner</a> in the flat, but Reisner made a one-handed grab and, thanks to a key block from <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160857\">Brandon Myers</a>, ran 16 yards to make it 28-9 with 1:38 left in the third quarter.\n\nSherer was picked off by Pat Angerer early in the fourth quarter, and Greene put a capper on his best day yet with a 34-yard touchdown run to give the Hawkeyes a 35-9 lead with 9:18 left.\n\n\"It's that feeling of, when something negative goes wrong it affects a couple different areas and that has a cumulative effect on your mentality, Bielema said. \"Any time you're a little mentally beat down, you become physically beat down.\"\n\nUntil the past two games, Iowa's problem was that it couldn't win the close ones. The Hawkeyes won't have to worry about that if they keep pounding teams like they have these past two weeks, when they've outscored their opponents 83-25.\n\n\"I don't think our confidence has ever been down,\" defensive tackle Mitch King said. \"We knew we were there. We knew we were close.\"\n\nStanzi had 114 yards passing and a touchdown for Iowa, which reclaimed the Heartland Trophy after two straight losses to Wisconsin.\n\n<a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236715\">John Clay</a> led the Badgers with 89 yards rushing, and <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236711\">Zach Brown</a> added a late 21-yard touchdown run. <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=180057\">P.J. Hill</a> injured his left ankle in the second quarter and did not return. He finished with 34 yards on eight carries.\n\nThe Hawkeyes, behind a pair of Greene touchdowns, led 14-3 at halftime.\n\nIowa went up 7-0 on its first possession, as Greene capped a 70-yard drive with a 12-yard TD run. His next score, a 34-yard run that made it 14-0 midway through the second quarter, was a thing of beauty.\n\nGreene burst into Wisconsin's secondary, juked cornerback Chris Maragos and, after shaking off safety Jay Valia's attempt to drag him down from behind, dashed into the end zone.\n\nThat dazzling run even got Stanzi's attention -- and he was supposed to be carrying out a play-fake.\n\n\"I stopped because I saw him go through the line and [thought] 'I'm just going to watch this one,'\" Stanzi said. \"It's like, how much better can he get? He's doing everything he's supposed to do to help us out.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
