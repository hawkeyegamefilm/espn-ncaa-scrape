Pa. -- Penn State grounded Iowa's best-in-the-Big Ten passing attack, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=503340\" target=\"_new\">Silas Redd</a> ran for 142 yards and Matt McGloin capitalized on a fourth-quarter turnover with a touchdown pass in a 13-3 win Saturday.\n\nClinging to a 6-3 lead with 14:21 left, linebacker Gerald Hodges sacked quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381738\" target=\"_new\">James Vandenberg</a> and forced a fumble recovered by Nate Stupar at the Iowa 49.\n\n<inline1>\n\nThe Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0) pounded away at the tired Hawkeyes with 10 straight runs to the 2 before McGloin rolled right to find wide-open tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=503330\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Haplea</a> a 13-3 lead with 8:08 to go.\n\nIt was more than enough cushion for Linebacker U's tough defense. Vandenberg threw two interceptions over the last seven minutes and Iowa (3-2, 0-1) stumbled in its conference opener after a bye last week.\n\nAs was the case the previous two weeks, Joe Paterno coached the first half from the sideline before retreating to the press box after halftime. The 84-year-old Hall of Famer is getting over a sore right shoulder and pelvis suffered when receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=488429\" target=\"_new\">Devon Smith</a> accidentally ran into him at practice Aug. 7.\n\nIt was the Hawkeyes absorbing the big blows on Saturday.\n\nIowa seemingly regained momentum in the tense affair after Micah Hyde intercepted a poor throw by McGloin in the end zone on third-and-5 from the 6, thwarting what had been a nice drive that started the Nittany Lions 4.\n\nBut as it has all season, Penn State's defense came through again.\n\nHodges got to Vandenberg on the blitz on third-and-7 from the Penn State 45, forcing a fumble that had the 105,00-plus fans rocking creaky Beaver Stadium.\n\nVandenberg finished 17 of 34 for 169 yards, while tailback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=500820\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Coker</a> had 74 yards on 18 carries.\n\nCoach Joe Paterno opted to go with the ground game after the fumble recovery, rotating carries for Redd, bruising backup tailback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=488950\" target=\"_new\">Curtis Dukes</a> (60 yards on nine carries) and fullback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=243289\" target=\"_new\">Joe Suhey</a> before McGloin found Haplea for a TD.\n\nThe sophomore tight end exchanged leaping high fives with teammates as blue-and-white fans frolicked in the stands. Not only did the score give Penn State a 10-point lead, but Haplea also scored his first career touchdown.\n\nIt only got worse from there for Iowa.\n\nSafeties Malcolm Willis and Nick Sukay each picked off Vandenberg down the stretch. Then Penn State's defense sacked the quarterback on three straight plays with less than three minutes left to push Iowa to a 4th-and-39 from their 1.\n\nIowa had come into the game averaging nearly 38 points and 281 passing yards a game.\n\nAnthony Fera's two first-half field goals made up for more early red zone hiccups for Penn State, which again rotated McGloin and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=501541\" target=\"_new\">Rob Bolden</a> at quarterback with middling results.\n\nMcGloin again looked a little better and finished 12 of 19 for 133 yards, while Bolden was 3 of 7 for 31 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
