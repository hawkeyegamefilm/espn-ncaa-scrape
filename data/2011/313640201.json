Its defense was solid before giving up a pair of touchdowns in the fourth quarter to lose nearly all of a 21-point lead.\n\nThen a camera fell from the sky.\n\nIt wasn't always pretty, but the Sooners grinded out a win, closing out a difficult year that included the death of a teammate and failed national title aspirations.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/501882/blake-bell\" target=\"_new\">Blake Bell</a> ran for his third touchdown in the closing seconds and Oklahoma (No. 14 BCS, No. 19 AP) survived a late rally, not to mention a crashing camera, to beat Iowa 31-14 in the Insight Bowl on Friday night.\n\n\"We did exactly what we wanted to: End this with a win,\" Oklahoma running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/501544/brennan-clay\" target=\"_new\">Brennan Clay</a> said.\n\n<inline1>\n\nOklahoma (10-3) didn't get a particularly great game from quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/377845/landry-jones\" target=\"_new\">Landry Jones</a> and wasn't effective on the ground, either. Once considered national-title contenders, the Sooners held off the gritty Hawkeyes, capping a painful year that started with the death of linebacker Austin Box in the offseason.\n\nJones threw for 161 yards with a touchdown and an interception, and Bell put the game away with a 21-yard touchdown run with 45 seconds left.\n\n\"It means a lot; these guys persevered,\" Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. \"(They) came out here tonight and played an excellent game.\"\n\nIowa (7-6) fell into a 21-0 hole before rallying behind two touchdown passes from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/381738/james-vandenberg\" target=\"_new\">James Vandenberg</a>.\n\nThe Hawkeyes came up just short and dodged a potential disaster when an overhead camera crashed to the field next to receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/236639/marvin-mcnutt\" target=\"_new\">Marvin McNutt</a> in the closing minutes. McNutt became tangled in the wire after the camera landed a few yards behind him, but wasn't hurt. The game was delayed five minutes while the camera was dragged off the field.\n\n\"First, I looked: What is it that fell from the sky?\" McNutt said. \"The next thing I know, the camera kind of scratched me a little bit. It was just pulling me and I knew I didn't want to keep going with it.\"\n\n\n      ESPN has consistently used the cameras for football coverage, \nmaking it a staple of \"Monday Night Football.\" The cameras also \nhave been used occasionally in the NBA, NHL, NASCAR, baseball, college \nbasketball and at the island-green 17th hole at the TPC Sawgrass during The Players Championship.\n\n\n    The cameras, despite flying over the playing field, have rarely interfered with the action.\n\n\t\"We apologize for the accident. The independent company that operates SkyCam for us is in the midst of a thorough review to determine the cause of the problem,\" ESPN said in a statement Saturday morning. \"We will work with them and bowl officials to determine our future course of action.  As always our primary concern will be the safety of fans and those on the field.\"\n\n\nMcNutt didn't have the only near-miss.\n\nVandenberg overcame an early interception to throw for 216 yards, and hit C.J Fiedorowicz and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/518391/jordan-canzeri\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Canzeri</a> on touchdown passes in the fourth quarter. He also had two interceptions -- one early and one late -- and Iowa's short-handed running game managed just 76 yards on 37 carries.\n\n\"We did something things to hurt ourselves, but Oklahoma had a lot to do with that,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said.\n\nOklahoma's return trip to the desert wasn't expected, at least not this early in the bowl season.\n\n<inline2>\n\nComing off a rout of Connecticut in last year's Fiesta Bowl, the Sooners were ranked No. 1 in the preseason, with hopes of a second national title under Stoops.\n\nThose aspirations were gone after a string of injuries -- All-America receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/232171/ryan-broyles\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Broyles</a>' torn ACL was the big one -- and two losses in the final three games, including a 44-10 rout by Bedlam rival Oklahoma State in the Big 12 championship game.\n\nThe frustrating run knocked Oklahoma out of not only the national championship chase, but out of a BCS bowl and into the Insight Bowl.\n\nInstead of making a statement in the desert, the Sooners seemed to stand still in the first half. Oklahoma had just 89 yards on 27 plays in the half, but led 14-0 thanks a pair of 4-yard runs by Bell -- one set up by an interception and another on the Sooners' only sustained drive.\n\nThe Sooners finally started to click, a least for a little while, in the second half.\n\nOklahoma drove inside Iowa's 10 on its opening drive, though that ended with an acrobatic tip-and-catch interception by Iowa defensive lineman Broderick Binns.\n\nThe Sooners didn't slow down, marching on their next drive for a 3-yard, play-action touchdown pass from Jones to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/241764/trent-ratterree\" target=\"_new\">Trent Ratterree</a> -- breaking a streak of eight straight TDs by Bell -- to go up 21-0.\n\nThe Hawkeyes finally fought back.\n\nIowa overcame the suspension of its top running back and a favored opponent to win last year's Insight Bowl, beating Missouri 27-24. The Hawkeyes did it behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/500820/marcus-coker\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Coker</a>, who ran for 219 yards and two touchdowns after replacing suspended starter Adam Robinson.\n\nThis time it was Coker who had to watch. The sophomore, who ran for 1,384 yards and 15 touchdowns during the regular season, was suspended for violating the university's student-athlete code of conduct.\n\nWithout Coker, Iowa would have to rely on a group of unproven running backs -- none had more than 18 carries -- and lean even more on Vandenberg.\n\nNo one was particularly effective in the first half.\n\nVanderberg was off-target early and had a pass intercepted by Jamell Fleming at Iowa's 31-yard line in the first quarter, then exacerbated the miscue by being called for a late-hit penalty. Bell scored his first touchdown two plays later.\n\nIowa had just one sustained drive in the first half, but that petered out; the Hawkeyes lost 3 yards on fourth-and-1 from the Oklahoma 6.\n\nTheir running game ineffective, the Hawkeyes bumbled around most of the next two quarters before finally moving the ball again late in the third quarter. Vandenberg completed seven of his eight passes on a 75-yard drive, the final an across-his-body throw for a 5-yard touchdown pass to Fiedorowicz that cut Oklahoma's lead to 21-7.\n\nVandenberg then got the Hawkeyes within seven with 7 minutes left, hitting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/480246/keenan-davis\" target=\"_new\">Keenan Davis</a> to convert on a fourth-and-10 to set up a 9-yard touchdown pass to Canzeri on a screen.\n\nThat was it, though.\n\nOklahoma's Mike Hunnicutt followed a 35-yard field goal with just over 4 minutes left and Bell added his final scoring run after the falling camera nearly took out McNutt, ending Iowa's school-record bowl winning streak at three.\n\n\"We had a couple of hiccups out there,\" Iowa defensive tackle Mike Daniels said. \"The results show when you have hiccups against a team like that.\"\n\nThankfully for the Hawkeyes and McNutt, the falling camera wasn't more than a hiccup.\n\n\n<i>Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.</i>"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
